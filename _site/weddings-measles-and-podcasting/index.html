    <p>So I have had an interesting week or so,<br />
It started with 18 hours on the road doing a trip to Huntington Beach for an old USMC buddies wedding. Since Ashley can‚Äôt fly this late in pregnancy we were forced to drive. And me being the consumate explorer we decided to go down the Pacific Coast Highway. What could possible go wrong ? ‚Ä¶ right‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. It actually wasnt that bad, until we got to Ventura. From there our trip time doubled. The drive, combined with the X Games selling out pretty much every hotel room really added up to a long day getting down south.</p>

<p>The wedding was great. A classic SoCal wedding, complete with the surfer priest. No joke, he even had a soul patch. The reception was held at the Costa Mesa Country Club. This place is shwank, 100k a year for membership. Erin‚Äôs parents really came through on this one. Aside from the location, it was great seeing Adam, Erin, Dan, Lott, and Linda again. I have changed so much, that no one recognized me at first. I guess 60 pounds, a beard, and longer hair can hide things üòâ .</p>

<p>Ashley and I drove north of LA that night, and made it to scenic Buttonwillow. Or maybe it was buttwillow. We got a room at the scenic Motel 6, the best room in town. After 5 hours sleeping in this room we recieved a call from the red cross. The lady on the phone informed my wife that someone who had german measles stayed in the room the night before. Ashley turned white on the phone. She responded ‚ÄúI am nine months pregnant‚Äù and the lady on phone said ‚ÄúOh my god‚Äù. Shortly after the lady asks if we were in a specific room. Luckily it was a large number off. Then at the end, she asks if we were in Nebraska. At that point Ashley returned to a normal color. Crisis averted, same thing for sleep.<br />
So that trip ended about 3:00 pm that day. I had a little break, fixed my laptop, got everything set up to be autonomous again. Did some phone interviews looking for that right place to land. Checked surflines (sadly it has been pretty flat), worked on the motorcycle, gossiped with friends, chatted up Kylie, surfed the net, did pretty much everything I have been putting off for so long.</p>

<p>Later that week I was back down south for the day. Sadly I had to get back up to the city that evening, or I would have gotten dinner with Dan down in PB. So everything went well down south, and I ended up being late for my flight. Luckily Southwest has pretty much the nicest employees on earth. I ended up on the next available flight without any charge or problem. You can‚Äôt beat that. I ran into some interesting people on the flight up. One was a MIT Business school grad. He moved up to the bay to do work with alternative energy development. Things like this give me that 1999 vibe. The bay is starting to get that buzz again. There are deals dropping everywhere. All that money the VC‚Äôs have held back is starting to flow. Even podcasting startups are getting 9 million in funding. I mean, come on ‚Äì Podcasting ? Are we in this build a cool product, advertise, get rich mode again? Scary and fun at the same time. I guess its time to party like its 1999.</p>
